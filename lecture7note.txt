lecture 7 note
controller, we should put code on controller but we will put code in route for now
you don't need to write a customer class in p3

route::get{'/list/{format?}, function($format='html')
? makes format optional, default is html if no parmarter is passed. 

if none of the if matchs, then you get nothing in the page? not error! 
you need an else to catch it? 
route is  case senistive you need to put to lower or something to catch them

use ->with($data) to pass data array to the view 
or use 
return View::make('list')
->with('name', 'susan')
->with('lastname','buck');

<?pho echo $name; ?>  in blade {{$name}}
<?foreach ...
@foreach
@endforeach

put clases in composer.jason, autoload section...
module is db related  Uppercase class name filename are singluar (e.g, man not men)
