css and php
using css class, create multiple class in css, in php code, return class name feed into the html 
so that the html know which class to falls into 
therefore, we can adjust style of multiple valuable in one valuable

ok to have php in th html to generate view in html 
<?php foreach($contestants as $key => $value): ?>
    <?=$key?> is a <?=$value?>
<?php endforeach; ?>

<?php for($i=0; $<10;$i++); ?>
    <?=$key?> is a <?=$value?>
<?php endfor; ?>


in the php file with no ?> closing php? because it is the last a space can pervent cookie or redirect
general rule don't close if it is just output
the code is already sent to the page? 

quick way to display content of array
<pre>
    <?php print_r($contestants); ?>
</pre

associative array, using string key as index

<?php	
	$arrayname['key1'] = 'value';
	$random=rand(0,count($arrayname)-1);
	$arrayname[$random] = "winner"; << if the key is numeric
	$count=0;
	foreach ($arrayname as $key => $value){
		if ($count == $random ){
			$constants[$key] = 'winner';
			break;
		}
		count ++;
	}
	$winner = array_rand($arrayname);
	$arrayname[$winner] = "winner";
	
use get, 
all the data on the form will travel on URL 

use POST the form data is not on the URL
print_r $_POST

<?php
$contestants=Array();
foreach ($_POST as $key => $value) {
	$contestants[$key] = 'Loser' ; //$key is the name of the field in the html post. 
									//here we are generating a list of input user name as index/key in the constestants array_rand.
									//the value is all loser until a winner is selected
	}
	$winner = array_rand($contestants); 
	$constestants[$winner] ="winner";
}
