code island is the block of php code 
<?php echo $total; ?> is the same as <?=$total?>
there is no semi-colin because its the last line? 
php no need to define the valuable type e.g. $name = 'simon'; it is all based on context. 

<?pho error_reporting(E_ALL);> on the very top of the html page to give me proper reporting
fatal error, warning, notice 
development, want to see all 3, but on production, you want to hide all of them 
E_ALL is a built in constant
ini_set('display_errors',1);

<?php

// Turn off all error reporting
error_reporting(0);

// Report simple running errors
error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE);

// Reporting E_NOTICE can be good too (to report uninitialized
// variables or catch variable name misspellings ...)
error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE | E_NOTICE);

// Report all errors except E_NOTICE
error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE);

// Report all PHP errors (see changelog)
error_reporting(E_ALL);

// Report all PHP errors
error_reporting(-1);

// Same as error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('error_reporting', E_ALL);

?>

phpinfo(); show the information of php on the server.

// to comment

you can take out the php block and create a new file and save as logic.php 
and use <?php require('logic.php'); ?>  << logic is ran as html pass thorugh this line


$statement = " you are $age years old";
$statement = 'you are '.$age.'years old';

do not repeat yourself principle

//string date ( string $format [, int $timestamp = time() ] )
[] is optional and will default to current time here.
